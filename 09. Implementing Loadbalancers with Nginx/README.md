# IMPEMENTING LOADBALANCERS WITH NGINX
Load balancing means distributing the work or task among several computers or servers so that no one computer gets overloaded with too much work. This helps to keep everything running smoothly and ensures that websites and apps work quickly and don't get too slow. For example, a set of webservers serving a website. In other to distribute the traffic evenly between the webservers, a load balancer is deployed. The load balancer is deployed in front of the webservers and all traffic gets to it first, it then distributes the traffic across the set of webservers. 

Nginx is a versatile software that can act like a webserver, reverse proxy, and a load balancer etc. All that is required is to configure it properly.
