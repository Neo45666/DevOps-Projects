# Implement a Client-Sever Architecture using MySQL Database Management System (DBMS)

This project explores the intricacies of client-server architecture using MySQL as the RDBMS. 
Client-Server refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another. In their communication each machine has its role: the machine sending requests is usually reffered to as "Client" and the machine responding (sering) is called "Server". 
A simple diagram of Web Client-Server architecture is presented below:
